<p>Hello! I'm Majella, currently studying at Las Pinas City National Highschool as a Grade 9 student. Throughout my grade 9 journey, there have been lots of ups and downs.</p>

<p>VPOP 2023 was an experience. There had been a lot of misunderstandings in our class, because of this contest. We were all stressing and tired of practicing. We would practice during thee weekends and weekdays just to perfect our performance. We were all going to be graded by every single subject that we had, so we had to do our absolute best. Day of the contest came, we were all getting ready, dressing up, and fixing our costumes. Before we went down to the front of the Villar building, we all prayed for our performance to go smoothly. We worked severely to make sure that we could show our very best. Coming closer to our time to perform, we were all nervous. Holding hands to calm eachother down. Then it was our time. We sang and we danced like it was our last (last na po talaga HAHAHA). Of course, it was not perfect, but we did our best. After the performance, we sighed out of relief. Tapos sinabi pong next year i-aannounce yung winners, so we were all devastated. 2024 came in, and we were awarded Champion of the VPOP! I say dasurvv!   </p>
<h3> Mr. and Ms. MVP </h3>

<p> Mr. and Ms. MVP was such an exciting part of the program of the ESP department. I remeber that we were all stressing trying to create the costumes for Kyle and Karlene. We were cramming like crazy, because we just finished the VPOP, and now we were preparing for this contest. We all supported Kyle and Karlene, making sure that they were comfortable in their costumes and were prepared and ready. The day of the contest came, and they did amazing! We would all scream when we saw Kyle and Karlene. The event lasted until 6PM and we were just waiting for the winners of the contes. Hakot awards silang dalawa. They both placed in the contest. Kyle being 2nd runner-up and Karlene being crowned as MS. MVP 2023.

<h3> Christmas Party </h3>

<p> Christmas party yung laging inaabangan ng lahat kapag end of the school year. 2023 with them had been great. I made new friends and we were all closer to eachother. It was a very memorable year.
<h3> Waltz Practice </h3>

<p> My classmates were tired because they had been waltzing for hours straight. They decided to sit down and tried to memorize their steps in a quite weird but I think effective way. Seeing the smiles on their faces while doing these silly things would really put your frown upside down.
<br>
<h3> Variety Show </h3>

<p>The variety show was really something. Throughout the whole process, we had a lot of ups and downs. It was just like VPOP, but even worse. This was even harder because there were different segments to practice and each of us had multiple segments. We would practice and practice until we got tired. The practices were hard, but they were quite fun. I was in the waltz segment, and it was my favorite part. Because of the VShow, I became fond of ballroom dances. I was also in the hiphop segment, but it was okay. I messed up a lot, but it's fine. We were all busy practicing, creating props, and writing songs. The day of the show we went to school before 7am. The performance would start at 8:30 and we were in the school's court. We were the only grade 9 section that would perfrom in the court, and all the sections would watch us so the pressure was extreme. The first part of the performance, we were all so tense. We were so nervous, because we had only practiced the whole show all-in-all once. There were a lot of mistakes, but natawid naman. As we were ending, the pressure and nervousness were starting to fade. We were all just enjoying and dancing to "Born This Way", kahit mali-mali yung steps. The Vshow was a great oppurtunity to showcase our talents. It was stressing, but we learned a lot throughout our journey in the variety show. </p>

<h2 align="center">Reflection and Insights</h2>
<p> Grade 9 has been a blast. When I was in the grade 8, lots of students said that grade 9 would be the most challenging part of junior high school. Although I haven't finished junior high school, 
I can say that Grade 9 has been quite challenging. Maraming nangyari. Nagsaya, umiyak, nagpuyat. Really stressing. Sa dami ng tasks na pinapagawa, I could not almost keep up. 
Kahit sobrang stressing, sobrang hirap, I made it through. Through my friends and classmates, who were with me throughout this crazy jouney in LPSci, I was able to survive. I had a lot of episodes where I wannted to give up, but being with them every single day made me realize that everyone has their own journey. Laht tayo nahihirapan at some point, but eventually, ma-oovercome din naman. I learned a lot of new things this school year, and there are a lot of changes that I would like to make in my next year here in LPSci. Garde 9 has been an amazing journey filled with mixed emotions and incredible people. </p><br>
